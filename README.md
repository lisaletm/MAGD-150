### Assignment 3
* The objectives of this assignment were to use variables, change the frame rate, register mouse position, and have the code do math for you.
* Moving your mouse over the black canvas creates blue/pink "bubbles" that remain on the canvas.
* Moving your mouse faster creates larger bubbles that are further apart.

### Assignment 5
* The objective of this assignment was to create interactivity through mouse or keyboard input.
* Part of the requirements was to form the composition according to the theme of "Television" or "Desktop Computer." I chose Desktop Computer.
* There are five circles placed at the four corners of the composition.
  * Clicking the top left circle makes all the circles bigger.
  * Clicking the top right circle makes all the circles smaller.
  * Clicking the bottom left circle moves all the circles slightly to the left.
  * Clicking the bottom right circle moves all the circles slightly to the right.
* Hovering the mouse over the bottom left white rectangle and pressing "X" on the keyboard turns the background white.

### Assignment 7
* The objective of this assignment was to create repeated assets by using arrays in the code.
* Part of the requirements was to form the composition according to the theme of "Halloween," "Retro Games," or "Nature." I chose Halloween.
* The background shows two graves. If you wait for a few seconds, a couple ghosts will float out of the graves.
* A ghost follows your mouse as you move it across the canvas.
